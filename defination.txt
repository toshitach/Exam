Defination of problem statement:-

Costono is a multinational company having 12 offices all over the world. They need to build  and host a website for their employyee so that they can have easy access to all the Corporate Customer Accounting related information. Through the website the employee can directly check the required information of specific constumer whenevr and wherever they want. It will increase the realibilty of the work employees are doing so far.
 As the company isn having 12 different office at different places ,it would be vey reckless process to gather the informatuion and save it on different platform. In addition to that every person saves the information according to his convienece and hence it would be very difficult for the other employee to access that information. And there would be lack of coordination hence we create a website on cloud platform so that the information would be safe  secure and accessible to all the employee all over the world working on the same project.
